# IXAII
The interactive XAI interface (IXAII) was developed as part of my master thesis "Design Principles for Interactivity in XAI Methods". It is an interface utilizing multiple XAI methods (SHAP, LIME, Anchor, and DiCE) and presenting several interactivity options. As this is only a prototype, it is only adapted for the Iris dataset.
